# Clogging (Pipe or Impeller)

## Root Cause
clogging

## Symptoms
- Reduced flow_m3h (below nominal)
- Reduced pressure_bar (head loss)
- Motor current may decrease or remain stable
- Valve may appear fully open but effective flow is limited

## Related Signals
flow_m3h, pressure_bar, motor_current_a, valve_open_pct

## Recommended Actions
- Inspect suction strainer and inlet piping for debris
- Check impeller for clogging or wear
- Verify pipe condition and potential blockages
- Consider backflushing or chemical cleaning if applicable

## Impact
Medium to High - reduces efficiency and capacity
