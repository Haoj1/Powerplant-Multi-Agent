# Bearing Wear

## Root Cause
bearing_wear

## Symptoms
- Elevated vibration_rms (above baseline)
- Elevated bearing_temp_c (above ambient + normal load)
- May accompany minor rpm fluctuation or motor_current_a increase

## Related Signals
vibration_rms, bearing_temp_c, rpm, motor_current_a

## Recommended Actions
- Check bearing lubrication level and quality
- Inspect bearing for wear, pitting, or contamination
- Schedule planned shutdown for bearing replacement if degradation confirmed
- Monitor vibration trend to assess progression

## Impact
High - can lead to catastrophic failure if unaddressed
